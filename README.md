# SDPD Police Stops Analysis by Region
This project uses Python with Pandas and Numpy to analyze the San Diego Police Department's stop dataset, which contains over 100,000 data points for police stops over the past couple years. With this data I aimed to investigate if the most usual types of stops differed based on differing regions of San Diego, and determine if this was correlated with external factors such as income differences.

The only libraries you'll have to download are Pandas and Numpy. Please use the resources listed below!
